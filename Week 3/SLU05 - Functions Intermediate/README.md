## Functions Intermediate

Now that you've got some fundamentals when it comes to functions, let's take a look at a few ways in which they can be
implemented and used. Since functions are all about allowing us to organize our code, the different ways functions can be
used gives us a totally new set of superpowers.


### Keyword arguments

Keyword arguments give you a new way to style your function inputs. With keyword args, you get a few nice things:

- Help the user of your function by providing default values to arguments
- When calling functions, makes it easier to read


### Scope

Scope is all about understanding how variables inside and outside of a function. It is absolutely fundamental to understand
when working with Jupyter Notebooks and will save you sooooooooo many debugging sessions in the future.
