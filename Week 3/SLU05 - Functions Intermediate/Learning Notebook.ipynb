So in this above function, we know that `a` is the first argument and `b` is the second argument. We can totally do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "divide(0, 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but we cannot do\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "divide(1, 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "because that would put `0` in the denominator. We can't have this. Not okay. Can't divide by zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you have a longer function with lots of arguments, this can start to become a problem. Say you've got a function like this:\n",

    "```py\n",
    "def lots_of_args(a, b, c, denom, d):\n",
