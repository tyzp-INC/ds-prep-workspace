## Functions Fundamentals

In this Learning Unit, you'll get your first exposure to the most fundamental and powerful tool common to all
programming languages: functions! In this Learning Unit, you'll get your first exposure in how to construct them
but by no means will you be an expert in them and that's okay. It takes years to master the composition of functions
in each programming language.

If there is one takeaway from this Learning Unit, it would have to be:


### Avoid repeating code by using functions

Instead of reapeating code, you should put the code into a function and call that function. 

That's it. Really. The most common and severe mistake that programmers make is to copy-paste the same code 
into multiple places rather than put it into a function. It takes a bit of extra brainpower but, in the end,
it, literally, always saves more time than it takes.
