    "\n",
    "Let's start with the most basic question and ask: what is a function? To answer this, we'll need to use some analogy and you'll have to be patient at the beginning. Only after some weeks or months will these metaphors start to really sink in and the goal of this LU is to place them into your mind so that as you progress down this journey the core concepts have a prepared place to sink in.\n",

    "### Metaphor: It's a box!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/its-a-box.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a function as a box that has some kind of machinery inside of it. This box has only a few rules about how to use it and they are very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have to give it some input\n",
    "2. You have to let the machinery inside of it work\n",
    "3. You get some output on the other side of it\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is the first introduction to a few very important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input, Output, and Machinery\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions take input. Functions produce output. This is commonly abbreviated as `I/O`. Get it? `I/O` = `Input / Output`? In your journey as a computer programmer, these two concepts will dominate almost every single thing you speak about, design, build, and use. However, without some machinery to do something to the input, you don't really have anything useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lots of things in the world take input and produce output. For example, we have things like a juice maker:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/juicer-analogy.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have toilets. In this case, you (usually) don't see the output:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/toilet-analogy.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have calculators (the machinery is hidden under the input devices):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/calculator-analogy.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why is this useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so let's think about what all of these analogies have in common. The automate work. Anyone can make some juice with their own to hands, a rock, and a cup. But do you want to spend all of your time doing that? Or would you rather invent a machine that does it for you? Anyone can go to the bathroom in a bucket and then manually empty the bucket when it's full but that causes disease and dispair so let's invent a set of machines and infrastructure to do that for us. Anyone can add a few numbers together with a pencil and paper but it is error-prone and time consuming so let's invent something to do that for us."

    "## Metaphor over, let's get to the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages let us build conceptually unlimited boxes of machinery that do our bidding. It is incredibly empowering. Many tasks that are done on a computer can be automated using machinery and functions are the most important tool that you have to organize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's see what a python function looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def name(_input):\n",
    "   output = machinery(_input)\n",
    "   return output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't take this literally, this is not a real function that does stuff. It just has the placeholders for the important concepts of `input`, `machinery`, and `output`. This is the basic syntax and pattern that you will use when writing functions. Take a moment, look at it closely, and notice where the concepts are located because it is important. If you don't implement your functions using exactly this pattern, they won't work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, upon close inspection, you'll notice there's one thing that is new: the `name`. We have to give our machine a name otherwise, we won't be able to use it. Think about if a juice maker, toilet, and calculator. The names of them are not part of the actual machine but it's essential that they have a way to refer to them or they would be completely useless in our society!\n",

    "This confusion has to do with the way that Jupyter is implemented. It is because it prints the **return value** of the cell to the screen next to a red `Out[]:`. If all the cell does is call a function without storing the value in a variable, it will automatically print it to the screen next to a red `Out[]:`.\n",

    "The key thing to understand here is that returning and printing are fundamentally different. You can see it in the implementation of the `print_added_numbers` function. It prints one value and returns another one. It can do this because printing and returning are different.\n",
